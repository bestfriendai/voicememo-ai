# VoiceMemo AI - Launch Thread

## Tweet 1 (Hook)
🎙️ I built an AI-powered voice memo app that transcribes & summarizes your thoughts automatically.

The best part? It actually works. 🧵

[Launch Day]

## Tweet 2 (Problem)
We take more notes than ever before.

But typing is slow. Handwriting is tedious.

And voice memos? They're just... audio files. Good luck finding anything in them later.

🎙️ Record
📝 Get transcript
📋 Get summary
🏷️ Get auto-tags

All in seconds. All on-device.

## Tweet 5 (Feature - AI Transcription)
"The Q4 revenue is up 15% YoY, driven by our new product launch..."

↓
"Q4 revenue up 15% YoY. New product launch driving growth."

AI turns 5 minutes of rambling into 2 sentences you can actually use.
